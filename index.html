      <p>Hello! I find that it’s always a little nerve wracking to write about oneself. I’m always stuck
        between saying nothing, which results in a blank and boring page, and sharing too much
        information, such as the contents of my breakfast. I hope for your sake that I have achieved
        the right balance between the two.</p>
      <p>I am currently enrolled in Case Western Reserve University’s Coding Bootcamp. This course has
        opened my eyes to the vast possibilities of what can be achieved through modern web
        development. I am excited to explore those possibilities. I am also passionate about solving
        problems and look forward to solving web and technical problems for companies and individuals.</p>
      <p>I am familiar with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and everything else that is important. I hope that you
        will consider me for you Full Stack Web Development needs.</p>
